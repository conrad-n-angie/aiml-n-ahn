The Asheville Homeless Network is a coalition of homeless people,
formerly homeless people, and their allies in the Asheville Area
coming together for the purpose of identifying and providing
information on services in the areas of housing, food, and
medical care, and other needs as identified. The Asheville
Homeless Network exists to do everything we can to serve the
homeless population of Asheville, and we are coordinating the
donation and distribution of food, crafts supplies, and other
needed items, plus whatever help we can find, direct, or
generate, directly to the homeless of Asheville. All staff is
unpaid; all funds received go directly to homeless people in our
community. The only fixed expense we have is the support of our
website.

The Austin Institute of Machine Learning exists mainly only on
paper. In fact Jon Conrad is the only faculty, at this time. A
grocer in Asheville, North Carolina has agreed to giving students
a discount, when we get around to printing student IDs.
